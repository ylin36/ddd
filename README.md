Domain Driven Design Notes and Templates

# Key definitions

## Domain
Field or industry a business operates in. Contains many activities.
Example: Amazon e commerce contains Sales, Shipment, Fulfillment, Web Portal, AWS Hosting, Payment.

## Subdomain
A domain can be broken down into several activities called subdomains. A subdomain can become a domain when focused on during the modeling process. 

Types of sub domain
### Core Domain
Main business flows and models. This is where core activities of the business is. eg. Discovering new medicine
### Supporting Domain
All activities that need to exist to support the core business function. eg. pharmacy medicine stock management
### Generic Subdomain
Common across many domains, but not part of specific core subdomain. eg. payroll

## Domain Expert
Goal is to understand the subdomains, and once identified, analyze them separately. It's difficult to master all domains, so people specialize and be domain expert in one domain while learning about others.
