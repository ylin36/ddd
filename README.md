# Key definitions

## Domain
Field or industry a business operates in. Contains many activities.
Example: Amazon e commerce contains Sales, Shipment, Fulfillment, Web Portal, AWS Hosting, Payment.

## Subdomain
A domain can be broken down into several activities called subdomains. A subdomain can become a domain when focused on during the modeling process. 

Types of sub domain
### Core Domain
Main business flows and models. This is where core activities of the business is. eg. Discovering new medicine
### Supporting subdomain
All activities that need to exist to support the core business function. eg. pharmacy medicine stock management
### Generic Subdomain
Common across many domains, but not part of specific core subdomain. eg. payroll

## Domain Expert
Goal is to understand the subdomains, and once identified, analyze them separately. It's difficult to master all domains, so people specialize and be domain expert in one domain while learning about others.

# Focus of DDD
Use DDD only for complex domains, 

Domain Modeling

Break domain into smaller pieces

Works well with agile scrum mvp. Create a basic model that everyone understands, yet can be evolved sprint by sprint until complete product is done.

# Building blocks of DDD
Entity

Value Object

Aggregate

Domain Event

Command

Query

Service

Repository

Factory

# Mapping domain to Model
